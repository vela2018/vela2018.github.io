Spanish_Body_Text: Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which
  evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the
  Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish
  come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century,[10] and the first systematic written
  use of the language happened in Toledo, then capital of the Kingdom of Castile,
  in the 13th century. Beginning in the early 16th century, Spanish was taken to the
  viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire, most notably to the Americas, as well as territories
  in Africa, Oceania and the Philippines.
